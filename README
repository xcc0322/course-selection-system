Background
This is my first integrated project of computer science major.
It was a course project for Database course at NCTU in the spring of 2013, the second year of my university.
I built it under the cooperation with two classmates in NCTU during my exchange semester there.
It was simple with no amazing features and ugly code. But it satisfied the requirements from the course and is the first milestone of my programming experience.
